# PYTHON-String-Generator
Simple string generator made in python, uses colorama modules for coloured text to console. This simple application will generate a random string which is useful for passwords. Word generator which will fetch a random word from "random_word" python module. Number generator which the client sets the from to end. Open source python project.

## Modules Needed:
```
pip install colorama
pip install random
pip install string
pip install random_word
pip install os
```

## How does this work?
##### STRING GENERATOR:
- This will simply use ASCII (https://asciidoc.org/) to generate a certain amount of characters that the user sets in the console. And the will print the string to console.

##### WORD GENERATOR:
- This will use the module "random_word" to simply generate a random word, please note this is not the best module to use, i recommened using a website to fetch from.

##### NUMBER GENERATOR:
- This will simply use randint, which is built into random. And will generate from what the user sets using inputs.
